# Core Principles

This document outlines the fundamental beliefs and guiding principles that shape our approach to software design, development, and maintenance. These principles are the bedrock upon which our more specific guidelines for architecture, coding, testing, and documentation are built. Adhering to these principles helps us create software that is simple, robust, maintainable, and effective.

## 1. Simplicity First: Complexity is the Enemy

**Principle:** Always seek the simplest possible solution that correctly meets the requirements. Actively resist complexity in all its forms – unnecessary features, premature abstractions, overly clever code, or convoluted layers of indirection.

**Rationale:** Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Simple code is drastically easier to understand, reason about, debug, test, modify, and maintain. Complexity is the primary source of bugs, development friction, and long-term maintenance costs.

**Implications:** We rigorously apply principles like YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It). We question the value proposition of every added feature or abstraction. We favor straightforward, readable code over compact but obscure implementations. Simplicity is a constant goal, not an occasional optimization.

## 2. Modularity is Mandatory: Do One Thing Well

**Principle:** Construct software from small, well-defined, independent components (modules, packages, functions, services) with clear responsibilities and explicit interfaces. Strive for high internal cohesion (logic within a component is strongly related) and low external coupling (components have minimal dependencies on the internals of others). Embrace the Unix philosophy: build focused components that perform a single task well, and compose them to create larger systems.

**Rationale:** Modularity tames complexity. It enables parallel development, allows for independent testing and deployment, facilitates code reuse, improves fault isolation, and makes the overall system easier to understand and evolve. It is essential for building scalable and maintainable applications.

**Implications:** This demands careful attention to API design and boundary definition between components. It enforces a strong separation of concerns and promotes composability. Our architectural guidelines are heavily influenced by this principle.

## 3. Design for Testability: Confidence Through Verification

**Principle:** Testability is not an optional add-on or a phase that happens "later"; it is a fundamental, non-negotiable design constraint considered from the very beginning. Structure code—using techniques like clear interfaces, dependency inversion, and separation of concerns—so that its behavior can be easily and reliably verified through automated tests. Focus tests on *what* the code achieves (its public API, its behavior, its contracts), not *how* it achieves it (internal implementation details).

**Rationale:** Automated tests are crucial for building confidence, preventing regressions, enabling safe refactoring, and acting as precise, executable documentation. Code that is inherently difficult to test without elaborate mocking or complex setup is often a sign of poor design (e.g., high coupling, mixed concerns).

**Implications:** Testability requirements directly influence architectural choices. We prefer integration or workflow tests that verify component interactions through public APIs over unit tests that require mocking internal collaborators. Difficulty in testing is a strong signal to refactor the *code under test* first.

## 4. Maintainability Over Premature Optimization: Code for Humans First

**Principle:** Write code primarily for human understanding and ease of future modification. Clarity, readability, and consistency are paramount. Aggressively resist the urge to optimize code for performance before identifying *actual*, *measured* performance bottlenecks in realistic scenarios.

**Rationale:** The vast majority of software development time is spent reading and maintaining existing code, not writing new code from scratch. Premature optimization often introduces significant complexity, obscures the original intent, makes the code harder to debug and modify, and frequently targets non-critical performance paths, yielding negligible real-world benefit while incurring high maintenance costs.

**Implications:** We prioritize clear, descriptive naming. We enforce consistent code style through automated tools. We favor straightforward algorithms and data structures unless profiling proves a more complex approach is necessary. Optimization is a targeted activity driven by data, not speculation.

## 5. Explicit is Better than Implicit: Clarity Trumps Magic

**Principle:** Make dependencies, data flow, control flow, contracts, and side effects as clear and obvious as possible within the code. Avoid "magic" behavior that relies on hidden conventions, global state modifications, or complex implicit mechanisms. Leverage the power of strong typing systems and descriptive naming.

**Rationale:** Explicit code is easier to understand, reason about, debug, and refactor safely. Implicit behavior obscures dependencies, makes tracing execution paths difficult, and often leads to unexpected side effects or coupling.

**Implications:** We favor techniques like explicit dependency injection over global singletons or service locators. We rely heavily on static type checking (TypeScript, Go types) to define and enforce contracts. Function signatures should accurately reflect dependencies and potential side effects where possible.

## 6. Automate Everything: Eliminate Toil, Ensure Consistency

**Principle:** Automate every feasible repetitive task in the development lifecycle. This includes, but is not limited to: running tests, linting code for style and potential errors, formatting code for consistency, building artifacts, managing dependencies, and deploying applications. If a task is performed manually more than a couple of times, it's a candidate for automation.

**Rationale:** Automation drastically reduces the potential for manual error, ensures consistency across different developers and environments, frees up valuable developer time for creative problem-solving, provides faster feedback loops, and makes processes repeatable and reliable.

**Implications:** This requires an upfront and ongoing investment in robust build scripts, CI/CD pipelines, testing infrastructure, and standardized development environment configurations. The goal is to make the correct way the easy way.

## 7. Document Decisions, Not Mechanics: Explain the *Why*

**Principle:** Strive for code that is largely self-documenting through clear naming, logical structure, and effective use of the type system – this covers the *how*. Reserve comments and external documentation primarily for explaining the *why*: the rationale behind a non-obvious design choice, the context surrounding complex logic, critical constraints, or the trade-offs considered.

**Rationale:** The mechanics of code change frequently, causing comments detailing the "how" to become quickly outdated and misleading. The *reasoning* behind a design, however, provides enduring value for maintainers trying to understand the system's evolution and constraints. Self-documenting code reduces the burden of keeping separate documentation synchronized.

**Implications:** We prioritize writing clean, expressive code. Comments should add value by explaining intent or context. When important, document key design decisions to track the evolution of the project's design and justifications for significant choices.
