# Whetstone

Whetstone is a mobile app for tracking your reading. It's like a trimmed down, open-source Goodreads with a focus on notes, and none of the social features.

## Technology

The Whetstone codebase is built with React Native, Expo, and TypeScript. Whetstone uses [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/products/auth) for user authentication, [Firebase Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore) as a database, and [Firebase Storage](https://firebase.google.com/products/storage) to host user-uploaded images for their books.

## Usage

Whetstone is currently available for free in the App Store on iOS. An Android release is in the works.
